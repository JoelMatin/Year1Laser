# Year1Laser
Control of lasers to draw complex shapes on a board

This project was made in collaboration with HANSSENS Dimitri, JOUSTEN Maxence, LINDEMANN Theresa, NACHTERGAL Marine, NOUBAYO WOUASSI Yann Ketis,
POLLIN Mano, STEINKUHLER Lucas under the mentorship of KOMINO Alissa and supervising of DEBEIR Olivier for the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles in the context of the first 
year course TRANS-H-102. The goal was to made use galvanometers attached to lasers to draw complex and simple shapes on a projection wall. As detailled in the report, a deep study of mass-spring systems was made before diving into experiments and the code to control the galvanometers using analogies from the mass-spring systems. Very good results
were obtained among the best from our year's prom. Enjoy !
